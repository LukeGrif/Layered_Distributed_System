        <h2>About the Job Marketplace</h2>
        <p>
            The Job Marketplace is a dynamic online platform designed for connecting job providers with skilled freelancers across various industries. Created as part of a distributed systems project, this portal focuses on efficiency, role-based access control, and streamlined job management — all powered by Jakarta EE and JSF.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by the mythical creature <strong>Griffin</strong> — a legendary guardian with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle — our platform embodies strength, vision, and integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
             Much like the Griffin, which represents power and wisdom, the <strong>Job Marketplace</strong> was built to protect opportunity and encourage fair, skill-based collaboration. Our goal is to connect job providers and freelancers in a secure, organized, and efficient digital space.
        </p>
        <p>
            Founded on the 30th March 2025 by current CEO Luke Griffin.
